# Hello, thank you for stopping by! 

# My name is Michael and I'm currently based in San Francisco, California. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems in May 2023 from Cal Poly Pomona.

# I've worked with SQL for the past 4 years through various coursework, projects, and personal exploration. My journey has exposed me to Postgres, MS SQL Server, MySQL, and Erwin Database Modeler applications. I still have much to learn but am excited to use this platform to learn, share my work, and grow!

# Please find this repository as a showcase of my work!
